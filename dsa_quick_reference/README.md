# dsa_quick_reference

This is the first project for the ITI Winter Training 2021 - Mobile App Development using Flutter. The application is mainly a reference for data structures and algorithms. Of course, the material included in the app is not thorough, since a more ambitious content would require much more time, possibly a month or more. So, only a few data structures along with a few algorithms are chosen and are presented briefly.
